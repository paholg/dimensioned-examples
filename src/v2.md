```rust
// @ Imports, etc.
extern crate dimensioned as dim;
extern crate time;

use dim::si::{Meter, M, Second, S};

use std::path::Path;

use time::precise_time_s;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;

use vector3d::Vector3d;

mod vector3d;
```

Once `const_fns` are stable, this can be replaced with a much nicer call to `Meter::new()`.

```rust
const R: Meter<f64> = Meter {
    value: 1.0,
    _marker: std::marker::PhantomData,
};
```


We will need the `norm2()` function from `Vector3d`, so let's make it work on vectors with
units.

```rust
trait Norm2 {
    type Output;
    fn norm2(self) -> Self::Output;
}

use dim::si::SI;
use dim::typenum::{Prod, P2};
use std::ops::Mul;
impl<A> Norm2 for SI<Vector3d, A>
    where A: Mul<P2>
{
    type Output = SI<f64, Prod<A, P2>>;
    fn norm2(self) -> Self::Output {
        SI::new(self.value.norm2())
    }
}
```

We'll define our own wrapper around `precise_time_s` so that it has dimensions.

```rust
fn time() -> Second<f64> {
    precise_time_s() * S
}
```

We're just doing very basic argument parsing for now.

```rust
fn main() {
    let argv: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();

    if argv.len() != 5 {
        println!("Call with {} N len iter
    where N is the number of spheres (must be a cube),
        len is the length of the cell sides,
        iter is the number of iterations to run for,
        fname is name to save the density file.", argv[0]);
        panic!("Arguments bad!");
    }
```

These immutable variable determine the parameters of the simulation.

```rust
    let n: usize = argv[1].parse().expect("Need integer for N");
    let len = argv[2].parse::<f64>().expect("Neat float for len") * M;
    let iterations: usize = argv[3].parse().expect("Need integer for iterations");
    let scale: f64 = 0.05;
    let de_density = 0.01 * M;
    let density_fname = &argv[4];
    let density_path = Path::new(density_fname);
```

As the simulation runs, we would like to keep a histogram of where we've seen
spheres. This will let us find the density.
Periodically, we will check where they all are, and for each sphere, the bin that contains
its center will get a count.

The `Deref` trait is implemented for `SI<V, A> -> V` only for dimensionless quantities, so
we can go from `len/de_density` to a primitive in a convenient, yet dimensionally safe,
manner.

```rust
    let density_bins: usize = *(len / de_density + 0.5) as usize;
```

We only have walls in the z dimension, which means the density will be constant in the x
and y dimensions. We don't care about getting that data, so our histogram can be just
one-dimensional.

```rust
    let mut density_histogram: Vec<usize> = vec![0; density_bins];
    let mut spheres: Vec<Meter<Vector3d>> = Vec::with_capacity(n);
```


We will now set up an inital grid of spheres. We will place them on a face-centered cubic (fcc)
grid.

```rust
    let min_cell_width = 2.0 * 2.0f64.sqrt() * R;
    let cells = *(len / min_cell_width) as usize;
    let cell_w = len / (cells as f64);

    if cell_w < min_cell_width {
        panic!("Placement cell size too small");
    }
```

Oops, we run into our first problem here. We need to make vector's from `cell_w`, but it
has dimensions so we can't directly. We have to pull out the value, put that in the vector,
and then wrap the whole vector in dimensions. This is essentially
dimensioned's version of an unsafe block, and it could be avoided by using a generic
vector with the dimensions on the inside.

I would like to wrap these vectors in dimensions by simply multiplying by `M`.

We could multiply with `M` on the right, then we would have to implement `Mul<SI<f64, A>>
for Vector3d`, which we wouldn't be able to do if it were defined in another crate.

We could multiply with `M` on the left if we use the `oibit` feature of dimensioned, but
that requires a nightly version of the compiler.

So, we'll just be boring and call the constructor `Meter::new()`.

Once our variables are wrapped in dimensions, though, this stops being an issue.

Anyway, this array gives offsets for the fcc lattice.

```rust
    let offset = [Meter::new(Vector3d::new(0.0, cell_w.value, cell_w.value) / 2.0),
                  Meter::new(Vector3d::new(cell_w.value, 0.0, cell_w.value) / 2.0),
                  Meter::new(Vector3d::new(cell_w.value, cell_w.value, 0.0) / 2.0),
                  Meter::new(Vector3d::new(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) / 2.0)];
```

We will now iterate over the cells and place the spheres in a grid.

```rust
    let mut b: usize = 0;
    'a: for i in 0..cells {
        for j in 0..cells {
            for k in 0..cells {
                for off in offset.iter() {
```

We have to do that same dimensionally unsafe trick here. At least we get
the benefit of our dimensions for the addition.

```rust
                    spheres.push(Meter::new(Vector3d::new((i as f64) * cell_w.value,
                                                          (j as f64) * cell_w.value,
                                                          (k as f64) * cell_w.value)) +
                                 off.clone());
                    b += 1;
                    if b >= n {
                        break 'a;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

Let's verify that we didn't place any spheres overlapping eachother, as they would get
stuck like that and mess up the simulation results.

```rust
    for i in 0..n {
        for j in 0..n {
            if i != j && overlap(spheres[i], spheres[j], len) {
                panic!("Error in sphere placement!!!");
            }
        }
    }

    println!("Placed spheres!");

    // fimxe: these should be consts in si
    let minute = 60.0 * S;
    let hour = 60.0 * minute;
    let day = 24.0 * hour;
```


We'll output data starting at this interval, and doubling each time

```rust
    let mut output_period = 1.0 * S;
```

until we reach this interval

```rust
    let max_output_period = 30.0 * minute;
```

Let's start the clock!
```rust
    let start_time = time();
    let mut last_output = start_time;
```

Here's our main program loop

```rust
    for iteration in 1..iterations + 1 {
```

We'll start by moving each sphere once

```rust
        for i in 0..n {
            let temp = random_move(&spheres[i], scale, len);
            let mut overlaps = false;
            for j in 0..n {
                if j != i && overlap(spheres[i], spheres[j], len) {
                    overlaps = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
```

We only want to keep the move if it was valid. We can't be moving our spheres into
eachother!

```rust
            if !overlaps {
                spheres[i] = temp;
            }
        }
```

Now we update the histogram wherever we have spheres. We could do this more or less
frequently, but after moving each sphere seems like a pretty good time.  Note that we
get to use that dereference trick again to go from `Unitless<f64>` to `f64` safely.

```rust
        for i in 0..n {
            let z_i: usize = *(spheres[i][2] / de_density) as usize;
            density_histogram[z_i] += 1;
        }
```

If enough time has lapsed, we'll save our data to a file.

```rust
        let now = time();
        if (now - last_output > output_period) || iteration == iterations {
            last_output = now;
            output_period = if output_period * 2.0 < max_output_period {
                output_period * 2.0
            } else {
                max_output_period
            };
            let elapsed = now - start_time;
```

Note that, like `Deref`, this `map` function is only defined for unitless
quantities. There is also a `map_unsafe()` function that works on quantitied with
units, but its use should be avoided if possible as it circumvents all the unit
safety that dimensioned provides.

```rust
            let seconds = (elapsed / S).map(|x| x as usize) % 60;
            let minutes = (elapsed / minute).map(|x| x as usize) % 60;
            let hours = (elapsed / hour).map(|x| x as usize) % 24;
            let days = (elapsed / day).map(|x| x as usize);
            println!("(Rust) Saving data after {} days, {:02}:{:02}:{:02}, {} iterations \
                      complete.",
                     days,
                     hours,
                     minutes,
                     seconds,
                     iteration);
```

Saving density
```rust
            let mut densityout = File::create(&density_path).expect("Couldn't make file!");
            let zbins: usize = *(len / de_density) as usize;
            for z_i in 0..zbins {
                let z = (z_i as f64 + 0.5) * de_density;
                let zhist = density_histogram[z_i];
                let data = format!("{:6.3}   {}\n", z / R, zhist);
                match densityout.write(data.as_bytes()) {
                    Ok(_) => (),
                    Err(e) => println!("error writing {}", e),
                }
            }
        }
    }
