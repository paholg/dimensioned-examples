# Dimensioned Examples

This repository contains some examples demonstrating the use of
[dimensioned](https://github.com/paholg/dimensioned/), a Rust library for compile-time
dimensional analysis.

These examples are written in literate Rust with the help of
[tango](https://github.com/pnkfelix/tango).

## Hard Sphere Simulation

This example covers using dimensioned with vectors in a couple different ways. It illustrates how
one can use dimensioned with different libraries, and some of the limitations in doing so.

## Unit Conversion

If you're interested in defining your own unit system and being able to convert between it and
other unit systems, then please check out the conversion example here.
